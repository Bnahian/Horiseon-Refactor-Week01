# refactor-week01
This is homework for week 1 and the challenge is to make the code of the site more accessable
my site link: file:///C:/Users/Nomare/Desktop/Bootcamp/Homework/refactor-week01/index.html
This is the process I used:
Changed website name to Horiseon Homepage-->
Added a div style to make the search engine shift to the right-->
Added a nav--> 
Added display inline to make them sit side by side-->
