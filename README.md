# refactor-week01
This is homework for week 1 and the challenge is to make the code of the site more accessable my site link:
https://github.com/Bnahian/Horiseon-Refactor-Week0 
This is the process I used:
Changed website name to Horiseon Homepage
Added a div style to make the search engine shift to the right
Added a nav.
Added display inline to make them sit side by side
Added display inline to change the behaviour
Added an id so that the link can work properly
I divided all the paragraphs in sections for an easy flow
Added alts for images
Added <aside> to be clear that there was some added info on the side
