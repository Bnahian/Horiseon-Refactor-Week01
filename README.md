# refactor-week01
This is homework for week 1 and the challenge is to make the code of the site more accessable
my site link: file:///C:/Users/Nomare/Desktop/Bootcamp/Homework/refactor-week01/index.html
This is the process I used:

Changed website name to Horiseon Homepage

Added a div style to make the search engine shift to the right

Added a nav.

Added display inline to make them sit side by side

Added display inline to change the behaviour
